	a new content-based method for 
	systems without 
	the 
	human models which is used to produce system rankings. 
	The research is carried out using a new content-based 
	evaluation framework called FRESA to compute a variety of 
	divergences among probability distributions. We apply our 
	comparison framework to various well-established content-based 
	evaluation measures in text summarization such as COVERAGE, 
	their 
	RESPONSIVENESS, PYRAMIDS 
	associations 
	text 
	including 
	generic multi-document summarization in English and French, 
	focus-based multi-document 
	summarization in English and 
	generic single-document summarization in French and Spanish.

Introduction :

Corps : 
	 RELATED WORK 	  	One of the ﬁrst works to use content-based measures in  	text summarization evaluation is due to [5], who presented an  	evaluation framework to compare rankings of summarization  	systems produced by recall and cosine-based measures. They  	showed that  	there was weak correlation...

Conclusion : 
	VI. S AND FUTURE WORK 	  	This paper has presented a series of experiments in  	content-based measures that do not rely on the use of model  	summarie...

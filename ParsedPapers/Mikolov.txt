Corps : 
	2 Model Architectures 	  	Many different types of models were proposed for estimating continuous representations of words,  	including the well-known Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).  	In this paper, we focus on distributed representations of words learned by neu...

Conclusion : 
	4 s 	  	To compare the quality of different versions of word vectors, previous papers typically use a table  	showing example words and their most sim...
